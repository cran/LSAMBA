Description: Provides a lasso-based method for building mechanistic models using the SAMBA algorithm (Stochastic Approximation for Model Building Algorithm) (M Prague, M  Lavielle (2022) <doi:10.1002/psp4.12742>). The package extends the 'Rsmlx' package (version 2024.1.0) to better handle high-dimensional data. It relies on the 'Monolix' software (version 2024R1; see (<https://monolixsuite.slp-software.com/monolix/2024R1/>), which must be installed beforehand.
